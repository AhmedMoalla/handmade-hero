# Day 1: Setting Up the Windows Build

- Defined the `WinMain` entrypoint.
- Went through the compilation process through `cl` compiler.
- The [`build.bat`](../build.bat) script which setups the shortcuts for the build tools, is not the same as the one used in the series.
- A _Developer Powershell_ is directly spawned in Zed (current editor) which comes pre-configured. (see [settings.json](../.zed/settings.json))
- The command line args I use for `cl` are:
  - `/Zi`: Generates complete debug info.
  - `/Od`: Disables optimizations to make debugging easier.
  - `/MDd`: Links against the debug version of the C runtime.
  - `/Fe`: Specifies output executable name.
