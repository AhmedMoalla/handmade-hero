# Day 5: Windows Graphics Review

- Refactored all DIB-related[^1] global variables to their own struct `Win32OffscreenBuffer`.
- Removed the coordinates of the 'dirty' rect that `WM_PAINT` provides from `Win32DisplayBufferInWindow`.
  - This 'dirty' rect is the portion of the screen that should be updated because it was obstructed.
  - The whole window rect is going to be rendered at 60 FPS so it makes no sense to care about only a subsection of it.
- The `WM_SIZE` event is not handled anymore.
  - A fixed resolution is set at startup using `WinResizeDIBSection` which creates the global back-buffer.
  - After rendering to the back-buffer in `RenderWeirdGradient`, the `Win32DisplayBufferInWindow` will copy the back-buffer to the window.
- Added `CS_HREDRAW` and `CS_VREDRAW` to force the redraw of the whole window instead of only the section that was obscured by some other window or the display boundaries.
- Added `CS_OWNDC` which sets a single private device context in the window class that is not shared or reused.
  - Every time `GetDC` is called, the same device context is provided.
  - Now a single device context is declared at the start of the program.
  - Cleaning it up is not needed anymore as it will live as long as the game.
