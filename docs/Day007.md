# Day 7: Initializing DirectSound

- Made `InputGetState` and `InputSetState` stubs return `ERROR_DEVICE_NOT_CONNECTED` instead of `0`.

- Loaded DirectSound DLL with `LoadLibrary` then did the setup for audio in `Win32InitSound`.
  - Initialize a `IDirectSound` instance with `DirectSoundCreate`.
  - Create a 'primary' buffer using `CreateSoundBuffer` and set its format with `SetFormat` just to force the format on the primary audio device. The secondary buffer is what will be used to fill sound data.
  - This way of doing this is legacy and probably isn't necessary on modern hardware.
